3. **Port Harcourt Specialist Hospital** - Old GRA
4. **Kano Teaching Hospital** - Nassarawa

### Sample Projects:
1. Lagos General Hospital ICU Expansion (₦150M budget)
2. EMR System Upgrade - All Hospitals (₦50M budget)
3. Port Harcourt Emergency Wing Renovation (₦75M budget)

## Key Metrics Displayed

### Overview Dashboard:
- **Total Patients**: Aggregate new patient count
- **Average Occupancy**: Hospital bed utilization percentage
- **Total Revenue**: Combined daily revenue in NGN
- **Staff Attendance**: Overall staff presence percentage

### Hospital-Specific Metrics:
- Bed occupancy percentage with trend indicators
- New patient admissions
- Daily revenue generation
- Staff attendance ratios
- Critical alert counts
- Department operational status

### Alert Thresholds:
- **Critical Occupancy**: >95%
- **Warning Occupancy**: >85%
- **Low Inventory**: <10 items
- **Staff Shortage**: <75% attendance

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used:
- React with Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- Lucide React for icons
- Canvas API for real-time charts
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Intl API for Nigerian locale formatting

### Performance Optimizations:
- Conditional rendering for expanded views
- Memoized calculations for aggregates
- Efficient canvas rendering for charts
- Debounced auto-refresh intervals

## Responsive Design Features:
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Collapsible navigation
- Touch-friendly interaction elements
- Adaptive grid systems

## Real-Time Features:
- Auto-refresh with configurable intervals
- Live data simulation for demo
- Animated chart updates
- Dynamic alert generation
- Real-time metric calculations

## Future Enhancements Planned:
1. WebSocket integration for true real-time data
2. Historical data comparison views
3. Export functionality (PDF reports, Excel)
4. Custom alert configuration per hospital
5. Predictive analytics integration
6. Heat map visualizations for geographic distribution
